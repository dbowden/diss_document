Post-ISA Agenda

1. Merge anything from previous prospectus draft that can be used into ISA paper

2. Reframe for broader project - intro, lit review

3. Expand theoretical framework. Ideological differences, hawk/dove splits.

4. List of factors that predict each phenomenon - fragmentation, joining

4. Add theory for remaining analyses, focusing on network theory

5. Research design for remaining analyses

6. Possibly pilot study of network stuff

7. Add conflict management to lit review

Chapters:

1. Static network attributes and rebel structure
2. Dynamics - outside support
3. Case study
4. Extensions - behavior

Is initial rebellion structure carefully calculated/endogenous to pre-war network? Then outside support and new groups disrupt it?

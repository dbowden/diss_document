# A Theory of Rebel Alliance Formation

## Rebel Factions and Their Interests

I start from the assumption that governments in civil wars are opposed by one or more dissident factions. I define a faction as a set of people with relatively homogeneous beliefs and identities, that is capable of acting as a group. For example, a communist party might have Leninist and Maoist factions, and an ethnonationalist movement might have Christian and Muslim factions. Faction members likely will not share identical beliefs on every political question, and may not have identical racial, ethnic, or religious backgrounds. This might be especially true of factions organized around loyalty to a specific individual or locale. A faction will, however, tend to be unified on the most salient political and identity issues of the moment. 

In some contexts, the faction may not be an appropriate unit of analysis. For example, rebel groups often do engage in recruiting new members on an individual basis, and an individual-level approach would be appropriate for studying such a phenomenon. For the formation and restructuring of rebel groups, however, decisions tend to be made by collectives. @Staniland2014 argues that rebel groups tend to emerge from existing organizations, rather than spontaneous collections of individuals. My own data collection shows similar patterns, with 97% of rebel groups since 1946 having origins in a pre-existing organization. When rebel groups fragment, abandonment of the existing group is often done by entire sub-units. For example @Staniland2014 finds that fragmentation often takes the form of local brigades breaking away from a central organization. EXAMPLE Similarly, @Christia2012 sees realignment as being driven by mid-level rebel commanders, who generally take a cadre of loyal forces with them when initiating and breaking alliances.

Factions can structured in a variety of arrangements during a conflict. A faction can resort to violence on an individual basis, resulting in a rebel group with mostly homogeneous preferences and identities. In other cases a faction may ally with others to former a larger, but more heterogeneous rebel group. Finally, factions may remain non-violent, using peaceful tactics to oppose the government. These arrangement are dynamic, however. Previously independent factions may form alliances, previusly aligned factions may choose to break alliances, previously non-violent factions may choose to enter a conflict, and previously violent factions may choose to demobilize. I argue that two broad concerns shape each these decisions.

First, I assume that factions have genuine political interests. This assumption is not necessarily obvious in light of the long-running debate as to whether rebellion is motivated by public or private concerns [see @Collier2004]. Indeed, some scholars have gone as far as to posit that rebellion is little more than glorified criminal activity aimed at controlling natural resources and illicit trades [@mueller00], or that individual participation is often motivated by a desire to settle personal disputes [@Kalyvas2006]. I do not reject the notion that rebels value such things (indeed, see the second assumption below); I simply contend that greed and grievance are a false dichotomy. Most rebel groups articulate a political platform of some variety. This might take the form of a comprehensive ideological program such as a communist revolution, or a more narrow concern such as land reform or self-determination for a particular ethnic group. While earlier work found greater support for the greed hypothesis, suggesting that such political rhetoric is merely a veneer on more selfish motives, recent studies using higher-quality data have found that political grievances, and particularly ethnic discrimination, to be among the strongest predictors of civil war [@Cederman2010]. 

Second, however, I expect that factions will seek to maximize their individual power. Even if rebels are primarily motivated by political interests, material resources are an important means to achieving such goals. A faction's influence in any postwar order is likely to be shaped in large part by its power. If a faction retains enough fighting capability to re-open violence, other actors interested in peace will have an interest in accommodating many of their demands. Relatedly, a faction will have difficulty trusting any concessions it wins from more powerful actors. Thus, retaining capability at the end of a conflict is likely to be advantageous with respect to advancing one's political goals [@Nygard2014]. Furthermore, greater power allows a faction greater autonomy from fellow rebels. Political power is a finite good, and as a group's capabilities increase, the number of other rebels with whom they must share it decreases [@Christia2012; @Bapat2012]. Finally, even if it is not their primary motive, rebels do use material resources to incentivize recruitment and retention efforts [@Weinstein2007], and to enrich top leadership.

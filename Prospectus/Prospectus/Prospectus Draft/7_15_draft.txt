abstract:
	Rebel groups face a dilemma. On the one hand, pursuing control of natural resources, territory, and civilian populations within the country may be a good strategy for enhancing their strength relative to the government. On the other hand, this tactic often brings the risk of becoming entangled in conflict with other non-state actors, ultimately proving counterproductive. I argue that control of natural resources is often a worthwhile risk for rebels, particularly when they are losing the conflict. Non-state actors also experience conflicts of interest over control of territory, which tend to be acted upon by rebels that are experiencing success in the conflict. Under some circumstances, however, rebels are able to partition territory and access to resources, minimizing the scope of conflict with each other.

#Introduction

Rebels have a powerful incentive to avoid conflict with other non-state actors, and focus their resources on defeating the government. Yet, 35% of rebel groups between 1989 and 2014 engaged in conflict with another non-state actor.[^hook] Approximately half of these conflicts are fought between two groups that are each fighting the government, with the other half being comprised of a rebel group and a non-state militia. This puzzle motivates three broad questions. Why do rebel groups fight each other when they have a common interest in conserving their resources to fight the government? Why do rebel groups find themselves in conflict with non-state militias? Finally, how do some rebel groups avoid conflict with other non-state actors?

Civil wars featuring multiple rebel groups are more severe [@Cunningham2010a] and longer-lasting [@Akcinaroglu2012a] than dyadic conflicts. Yet, we know relatively little about how rebel groups interact. It is plausible that fighting between rebels is something that happens in addition to, rather than in place of violence between rebels and governments, thus explaining the heightened severity of these conflicts. Similarly, one might assume that adding actors to a conflict will bring a wider range of issues and interests, will reduce the value of a peaceful settlement by requiring power, territory, and other resources to be divided more ways. This would often lead conflicts to last longer. Alternatively, however, the severity of a conflict and the number of actors participating in it may each be the product of some other, underlying factor. Thus, understanding whether and how rebel interactions contribute to the overarching trajectory of conflict can help us to understand one of the most severe subsets of civil war.

Additionally, the renewal of violence following a civil war is often driven by competition between former rebels as they struggle to share power in a peaceful setting [@Atlas1999]. Yet as @Auteserre2010 argues, peace operations often underestimate the importance of subnational dynamics in conflict. Understanding the conflicts that emerge between rebels and other subnational groups during wars might help us predict the conditions under which former rebels are likely to re-initiate a conflict, and highlight the tensions between rebels that should be resolved during the peace process.

This project also contributes to an empirical gap in the literature. With the very large exception of the literature on ethnic conflict, few studies examine violence between non-state actors. This is likely due in part to the fact that theories of civil war often assume dyadic competition between a rebel group and government. In addition, there may be a belief that in the absence of government involvement, violence is not political. Yet, states often do not fully control their territory during civil wars, leaving rebel groups as the *de facto* public authority in some locales. Furthermore, a group that aims to replace the government or significantly alter its policies is inherently political. Therefore, opposition to such groups has a strong possibility of being political. Studying subnational violence therefore introduces a mostly overlooked category of political interaction to the political science literature.

#Literature Review
<!-- Convert this to a theoretical contribution section -->

In the most thorough study to date, [@Fjelde2012] suggest that rebels fight each other for control over resources such drug supplies or valuable terrain. Greater resource endowments should lead to better postwar bargains with the government in the long run, and greater ability to sustain a rebellion in the short run. The authors find that this logic is most likely to prevail in the presence of natural resources, territories that are not controlled by the government, militarily weak governments, and significant power asymmetries among rebels. @Atlas1999 find that this dynamic can also arise in the aftermath of conflicts, as the main fighting in renewed civil wars is often between previously allied rebel groups.

@Wolford provide important insights to the incentives underlying rebel interactions by considering the interdependencies in the emergence of rebellion. They treat the number of rebel groups in a conflict as endogenous to expectations about postwar bargaining. Potential rebel groups seek to balance competing preferences for minimizing their cost of fighting, and maximizing their share of the postwar settlement, each of which varies inversely with the number of rebels. The equilibrium number of groups is inversely related to the strength of the government, and to the quality of the prewar policy offer from the state. Counterintuitively, they find that the number of groups is also inversely related to the potential number of rebellions, as the expected share of the postwar settlement will be small when it is anticipated that many groups will join the fighting. The key insight of this model is that the number of groups in a conflict is only partially shaped by exogenous factors like ethnic divisions; there is a significant role for strategic choice. Due to its assumptions, the model cannot speak to scenarios in which potential groups pursue differing or non-zero-sum goals, nor to the possibility of sequential entry to the conflict.

Several works examine the emergence of conflict within previously coherent movements. [@Bakke2012a] conceptualize the fragmentation of rebels movements as varying in terms of the raw number of organizations, the degree of institutionalization unifying the organizations, and the distribution of power among them. They expect a greater general likelihood of infighting in more fragmented movements, particularly those with large numbers of groups and low degrees of institutionalization. [@Asal2012] find that ethnopolitical movements with factionalized leadership structures are most likely to experience splits. Similarly, [@Cunningham2012a] find that infighting is most likely in self-determination movements with large numbers of factions, and that the emergence of new factions is especially likely to trigger violence. [@Christia2012] also sees pre-existing social structure as a contributing factor to infighting, finding that rebel groups and coalitions tend to fragment when battlefield losses exacerbate divisions between faction leaders. [@McLauchlin2012] find that repression can deepen rifts within movements that are already divided, but cohesive movements may become further solidified by repression.

There is also a substantial literature on intraethnic violence. [@Lilja2011] find that that Tamil rebels used violence against coethnic civilians to control populations and the resources they hold, and against coethnic armed groups to establish dominance within the ethnic group. [@Staniland2012d] finds that these patterns intraethnic violence tend to be self-reinforcing, as violence within ethnic insurgencies is the primary cause of the defection of some subsets of ethnic groups to the opposing side in the conflict. [@Warren2015] seek to explain which ethnic groups are likely to experience such fragmentation, finding a curvilinear relationship between the size of an ethnic group and its probably of experiencing infighting. Small ethnic groups have the ability to police themselves, limiting violence, and intraethnic violence in large groups is likely to be met with government intervention. Thus, only moderate-sized groups tend to experience internal violence.

Conflict between rebels is not inevitable, however. @Christia2012 argues that rebel groups will form in search of a coalition that is strong enough to defeat the government, but small enough to minimize power-sharing. These alliances are fragile, though, as groups constantly update their alignment strategy on the basis of battlefield outcomes. @Staniland2014 also finds that insurgent coalitions are common in civil wars. Unlike @Christia2012, however, he finds that these alliances can be stable if they develop certain internal structures. This is especially likely for groups that share social structure that predate the war, such as ethnic networks.

#Conflict Between Rebels

I begin with a brief discussion of the incentive for rebel groups to avoid fighting each other, followed by an exploration of the underlying conflicts of interest that might counteract the common interest in peace. I argue that natural resource wealth is enticing enough for rebels to contest, particularly when groups are desperate for enhanced capabilities.

##Common Interests

Rebel groups share a common interest in defeating the government.[^scope]  While the expansiveness of their aims against the government may vary, with some groups hoping to overthrow the government and others simply attempting to secure a concession such as regional autonomy, rebels have a common incentive to avoid conflict with each other so as to conserve their resources for the fight against the government. All else equal, rebel groups should prefer to secure victory as quickly as possible, with minimal losses to their forces and minimal damage to the country they might soon govern.

##Conflicts of Interest

As @Christia2012 and @Wolford note, rebels wish to defeat the government, but also to minimize power sharing in the event that they prevail in the conflict. If two groups each seek to overthrow the existing government and assume control of the state for themselves, they will face an inevitable conflict of interest if the government is defeated. In other cases rebel goals may be partially congruent, again leading to conflict. For example, one rebel group may be seeking control of the central government, while another is pursuing secession for a resource-rich region of the country. While these groups share a common enemy in the short run, when the government is defeated the former group is likely to oppose the secession of the latter. In still other cases, however, rebel objectives may be compatible. For instance, two groups may each emerge to oppose economic policies, repression, or a head of state's decision to delay elections, differing only in the segments of society from which they draw support. In this case, there is likely to be a strong basis for cooperation even as focus shifts to the post-conflict period.

###Resource Conflict

Securing material for the war effort is a crucial task for rebels, and the type of resource base upon which a rebel group depends is a powerful determinant of rebel group behavior [@Weinstein2007]. Some groups finance themselves through the sale of natural resources such as gemstones, oil, or timber. Control of these resources provides rebels with easy means of funding weapons purchases, and of incentivizing recruits to join their movement. Supplies of these resources are finite, but their benefits seem to increase in a linear fashion as any surplus revenue beyond what a group needs to operate can become personal wealth for group members. Clearly, then, rebels should prefer not to share control of resources with other groups. Indeed, @ross04 and @Fjelde2012 find that rebels often fight for control of natural resources.

Civilian populations also serve as important resource bases for some groups.  Rebels often extract recruits, food, shelter, and other supplies from local populations. In some cases civilian groups provide this support voluntarily [@Parkinson2013], but maintaining the approval of civilians is often unnecessary as combatants can extract resources through coercion [@Humphreys2006]. Thus, these civilian resource bases are subject to capture and may change hands over the course of the conflict. This dynamic can lead to competition both between rebel groups. Unlike natural resources, however, civilian populations are relatively abundant and substitutable. Thus even though multiple groups may extract resources from a population at various times, competition for this category of resources should not be acute enough to overpower the incentive for cooperation dictated by their common interest in fighting the government.

Some rebels receive significant support from outside actors. For example, the RUF in Sierra Leone had significant support from the Liberian government, and the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka funded many of their activities with remittances from the Tamil diaspora. This category of resources is far less subject to capture and transfer between groups than the other two. While a rebel group could intercept arms or supplies intended for a rival, doing so consistently is unlikely. Thus, rebels with external support are unlikely to be targeted by other groups in conflicts motivated by resources. Furthermore, external support should make rebel groups less dependent on resources within their own country, and therefore less likely to initiate conflicts over resources.

*H1: Violence between rebels is more likely among groups that depend on  natural resources than among groups that depend on civilians or external support.*

While resource wealth should be of some value to all rebel groups, the possibility of a quick influx of funding should be especially valuable to groups in certain scenarios. Assuming that natural resources are always being controlled by some group, a bid for seizure of the resources carries some risk of failure, or at least of significant losses. For stronger rebel groups these risks may be minimal, but pursuing natural resources still entails an opportunity cost. If a group is already well-armed and well-funded, it might prefer to devote its forces to taking government territory. It should then be risk-acceptant actors that are most likely to pursue the high reward of gaining resources. Most commonly, this condition will occur in groups that are experiencing losses in their battles with the government. @Wood2014 finds that rebel violence against civilians increases in the wake of battlefield losses, suggesting that rebels take detours from fighting the government when the conflict is going poorly. Pursuit of natural resources should follow a similar logic.

*H2: Rebel groups that are losing the war should be more likely than other groups to make violent challenges for control of resources.*

###Territorial Conflict

Rebel groups also face potential conflicts over territory, as rebellions are bids to control some territorial entity. This may include the entirety of a state's territory in the case of rebellions aimed at replacing the central government, or a specific region in the case of secession movements. These territorial ambitions can, but do not always form the basis of a conflict of interest between rebel groups.

The relationship between the territorial objectives of two (or more) rebel groups falls along a spectrum. At one end are groups contending for control of the same piece of territory. This can include groups that are fighting for control of the entire country, as well as groups that are pursuing secession or autonomy for the same territory. Rebels seeking control of the same territory face perhaps the sharpest conflict of interest. @toft02 argues that while in theory territory can be divided, in practice many territories assume symbolic importance and become indivisible. This is especially true of the homeland territories of ethnic groups. The finding is consistent with a large literature on international territorial conflict that views many territories as indivisible [@Hensel2005a], contributing to the role of territory as the leading cause of interstate war [@Vasquez199]. Thus, rebel groups aspiring to control the same territory have a conflict on the horizon that is not only zero-sum, but often winner-take-all as well. Furthermore, if multiple groups are making claim to a territory, it is likely that efforts to form a unified movement has already failed. Rebel interests in this setting are fundamentally in conflict, and for the groups to coexist they must compromise, either by sharing power or by dividing the territory. While there are cases in which such outcomes are acceptable to both parties (i.e. overlapping territorial goals are not sufficient for conflict), the potential for conflict on this part of the spectrum is nevertheless much higher that it is among rebel dyads with more compatible aims.

*H3: Rebels aspiring to control the same territory are more likely to fight than other non-state dyads.*

Next on the spectrum are cases in which the territorial objectives of rebel groups partially overlap. This might include a dyad comprised of one rebel group seeking to overthrow the government, and one group pursuing secession for a portion of the country. Alternatively, it might include two secession movements with partially overlapping claims. In this category there is again  conflict of interest between rebel groups, but to a lesser extreme, allowing for compromise in some cases. For instance, a group seeking control of the central government may calculate that conceding territory to a secession movement is a fair trade for the freedom to fight the government without worrying about threats from fellow rebel groups. In other cases compromise is less desirable. A group seeking to control the entirety of Nigeria, for example, would be unlikely to compromise with a groups seeking independence for the oil-rich Niger Delta region, as doing so would substantially reduce the value of a successful rebellion on their part. Similarly, a group that identifies closely with a specific ethnic group would be disinclined to bargain over territory that it considers to be part of its homeland [@toft02]. Thus, whether partial overlap of territorial objectives produces conflict depends on the value of the territory in either symbolic or material terms.

*H4: Rebel groups with partially overlapping territorial objectives are more likely to fight than other rebel dyads if the territory has high symbolic or material value.*

Finally, some rebel dyads lay claim to entirely different territories, such as secession movements for entirely separate territories. In this case territorial aims alone will not produce a conflict of interest. That does not necessarily mean, however, that these groups are likely to cooperate. Separatists tend to focus violence in or near their respective territories [@DittrichHallberg2012]. If rebels are fighting in adjacent territories, cooperating to fight the government might be a sensible strategy. If, however, the groups are operating in distant territories, they are unlikely to have much interaction of any kind.

*H5: Rebel groups with non-overlapping territorial goals are less likely to fight than other rebel dyads.*

As is the case with natural resources, the incentives to engage in territorial conflict vary both across rebels groups and over time.

##Territorial Partitioning

Although competition for territory or resources may often lead to conflict between rebels, in some cases they may be able to engage in limited cooperation to manage these conflicts of interest. The literature on criminology finds that, surprisingly, rival gangs are often able to mitigate resource competition through the creation of stable territories boundaries for each group [@Brantingham2012a,Tita2005,Taniguchi2011,Smith2012,Sibley2009,Radil2010]. Territorial partitioning in this context is a method of distributing resources and limiting the scope of violence by granting each actor in a system exclusive control over a geographic area. This is not to say that violence is eliminated completely under such an arrangement. Rather, actors simply refrain from attempting to destroy each other completely. Violence is still used in a limited fashion to enforce the arrangement (i.e. incursions into the territory of another actor are punished with violence), and to determine the distribution of new areas as groups expand [@Smith2012]. This arrangement is the result of a calculation that the cost of defeating a rival would be greater than the cost of sharing control of resources with them. The precise mechanism by which actors reach this conclusion is underspecified in the literature, though @Brantingham2012a use the fact that territorial partitioning exists among a vast array of animal species as evidence that it can emerge with little conscious effort. The key prediction of this theory is that violence should be concentrated along the boundaries between rival groups (as opposed to being interspersed throughout the territory of individual groups) [@Brantingham2012a]. Additionally, we might expect the level of violence to be less among groups engaging in this limited form of cooperation than it is among groups that lack such an arrangement.

Evidence for the existence of territorial partitioning of this sort has been found among street gangs in US cities [@Brantingham2012a,Radil2010,Smith2012,Taniguchi2011], prison gangs [@Sibley2009], and non-human species [@Moorcroft2006]. This arrangement should be likely among rebel groups as well, given the right conditions. Like criminal organizations, rebel groups are often in conflict over resources and postwar aspiration, which in a vacuum provides an incentive to defeat one another. If anything, however, the cost of pursuing such a strategy is considerably higher for rebel groups than for gangs, as rebels must devote resources to fighting the government. Indeed, @ross04 finds that rebel groups agreed to share resource wealth in the Second Congo War, though it is unclear whether this was implemented through territorial partitioning.

@Brantingham2012a specify the conditions under which we should expect a stable division of territory. From these, I develop hypotheses about territorial partitioning in civil war. First, groups must emerge from distinct geographic areas. In other words, two rebel groups from the same city may struggle to construct non-overlapping territories. This requirement of separate geographic bases is most likely to be met by rebel dyads with non-overlapping or partially-overlapping territorial objectives. Recall that the former category is comprised of separatist movements associated with different regions, while the latter consists primarily of groups seeking to overthrow the government paired with a secessionist group. The appeal of boundary making is intuitive, and in some cases unnecessary for groups with compatible territorial goals. Conceding control of some territory is suboptimal for groups with incompatible objectives. Yet, the arrangement is relatively low-risk as each group retains access to a resource base, leaving open the possibility of territorial revision at a later date.

*H6: Territorial partitioning is most likely to emerge among rebel dyads with non-overlapping or partially-overlapping territorial objectives.*

Second, stable boundaries are most likely to emerge when a group's potential for growth is affected as much by the other group's activities as it is its own [@Brantingham2012a]. This would be the case if no action a group could take unilaterally could increase its capabilities as much as a resource-sharing agreement with the other group would. The intuition is that if this were not the case, groups would be better off ignoring each other and strengthening themselves unilaterally rather than investing resources in enforcing a territorial boundary. Empirically, the presence of this condition is quite difficult to measure directly. We might assume, however, that this condition should exist only among groups that are relatively equal in power - a strong rebel group would likely be unconcerned with a much weaker counterpart.

*H7: Territorial partitioning is most likely to emerge among rebel dyads that are relatively equal in strength.*

Third, territorial partitioning is only likely when the parties involved hold territory that is relatively equal in value [@Brantingham2012a]. If one group holds a monopoly over the natural resources in an area, the other will not consent to a crystallization of the status quo. For instance, one rebel group could plausibly hold all of the mineral-rich territory in a country, whereas civilian populations are much more dispersed.

*H8: Territorial partitioning is most likely to emerge among groups that hold similarly valuable territory.*

Finally, existing applications of territorial partitioning models almost invariably consider the actors in isolation. Rebel interactions, however, occur in the shadow of government. Any territorial arrangement between rebels is likely to crumble if the government seizes some of the territory involved, particularly if one rebel group is disproportionately affected. While the emergence of a civil war is often indicative of a weak central government, this is not always true, and most government are capable of holding some territory. Thus, territorial partitioning between rebels is most likely to emerge in conflicts featuring weak central governments, and in geographic areas that are difficult for the government to control.

*H9a: Territorial partitioning is most likely to emerge in states where the central government is weak.*

*H9b: Territorial partitioning is most likely to emerge in geographically remote areas.*

#Conflict Between Rebels and Non-State Militias

Militias here mean armed groups that are not associated with the government, nor are they pursuing broad goals against the government (i.e. they are distinct from rebels). They are frequently associated with a particular ethnic group, locale, or clan. There are fewer common interests between rebels and non-state militias that are not in rebellion against the government. Most obviously, the latter do not necessarily have other enemies for whom they need to save their resources. This is not uniformly true, as militias may exist to protect civilians from government attacks, or from other militias. Still the purpose of such groups often seems to be defending a locale from threats, and fighting an encroaching rebel group would fit this purpose. Therefore, the cost of fighting non-state actors should be higher for rebels than for the average non-state militia.

The conflicts of interest between rebels and militias are mostly similar to those between two rebel groups. If militias hold natural resources, they are unlikely to surrender them willingly. Similarly, if militias are associated with a specific territory, the will almost certainly oppose rebel attempts to take it. In one area, however, the similarities do not hold. Whereas for rebels civilian populations are often interchangeable resource bases, militias formed on the basis of locale or ethnicity will often have deep connections to local populations. As these militias tend to operate in relatively circumscribed geographic areas, they are likely to be coethnics, neighbors, and even relatives of the local populace. Thus, unlike rebel groups, militias should be likely to forcefully oppose attacks on local civilian populations.

*H10: Conflicts between rebel groups and militias should be more likely following rebel attacks on civilians than at other times.*

#Research Design

##Dependent Variables

**Conflict Between Rebels** This variable can be constructed by cross-referencing the Uppsala Non-State Conflict data with the Uppsala Dyadic Conflict data to identify groups that fight both a government and another non-state actor. Unfortunately the data is limited to the period 1989-2014, but there are 69 instances of rebel-on-rebel conflict in this time.

**Conflict Between Rebels and Non-State Actors** This variable can also be constructed from the Uppsala Non-State Conflict data by identifying conflicts between one group that is fighting a government and another non-state actor. There are 136 such conflicts. This form of conflict is also captured in the ACLED data, which 2,498 conflict events of this sort.

**Territorial Partition** The ACLED data tracks the establishment of bases and seizure of territory by armed groups. These can provide an estimate of what, if any, core territory a rebel group holds. ACLED events are also geocoded, allowing one to determine if conflict events between rebel groups seem to fall along the boundaries of their territories.

##Independent Variables

**Natural Resources** A variety of sources, included the US Geological Survey, publish datasets capturing the volume and locations of natural resources worldwide.

**External Support** The Uppsala External Support data can be used to identify which rebel groups receive material support from external actors.

**Territorial Objectives** The Uppsala Armed Conflict Data includes a rudimentary coding of the issue over which civil wars are fought, but does specify the territory that rebel groups are seeking to control if it is less than the entire country.

**Rebel Group Strength** The actor data presented in @Cunningham2009 includes estimates of rebel group troop strength.

**Rebel Group Victories and Losses** Following @Wood2014, the trajectory of conflict can be measured from events data such as ACLED. Significant casualties, particularly relative to the government, might be considered a battlefield loss.

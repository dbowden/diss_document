#Testable Hypotheses

- Territorial acquisition (ACLED)

- Spatial distance / ease of travel between existing rebels and new protester/rioters (ACLED)

- Resource control/proximity (ACLED + Resource data)

- Temporal dynamics / leverage in peace negotiations (there should be data here)

- Civilian violence (ACLED, UCPD)

- External support (UCDP) NOT MUCH GOING ON HERE

- Joining is motivated by greed - new groups will veer toward resources

- Joining is motivated by politics - groups should stick around to get a seat at the table

- Does government block connections between new dissent and existing rebels?

- Protest episodes predict new group entry

- EPR spatial data - how often are there multiple rebel groups within an ethnic area?

- Are there rebel-protester events? NO, JUST A FEW

- Rebel control of territory. Within territory variation in resources, population.

- Rebel control of territory and refugee flows.

- (Closest I can get to Staniland's hypothesis) Does previous conflict activity in a geographic area increase likelihood of new groups forming there?

Multiple rebel groups occur when they occupy spatially distinct areas. Why not cooperate? Why not turn on each other in pursuit of resources?

Do government want fragmented rebels or not?

#Possibilities

- Past election data, public opinion data BALCELLS DID THIS (SEE THE ECK PIECE ON UCDP GED FOR A FEW OTHERS)

- Network-based measure of ideology (VERY LITTLE EXTERNAL SUPPORT IN THESE CASES)

#What Do We Know About Relationships Between Rebel Groups
- Outright fighting between them is relatively rare, especially recently
- There are rare cases of significant cooperation, but the modal relationship is neutrality
- They tend to occupy distinct geographic areas, but there are many exceptions
- Source/fragment pairs account for a large portion of the dyads in complex conflicts, but virtually every multi-actor conflict has at least one totally new group
- Transnational groups are likely to be involved in multi-actor conflicts
- Strong groups are less likely to be in multi-actor conflict, though the direction of the relationship is debatable
- Ideology/politics may play a role - ideological conflicts and groups with political wings are slightly more likely to be involved in multi-actor conflicts



#Questions
- When are new groups comprised of individuals who haven't fought before, when are they reconfigurations of existing combatants?


- Government behavior
    + Civilian targeting - should reduce individual-level free-rider problem
    + Bhavani et al - certain kinds of targeting may increase conflict between factions
- Rebel behavior

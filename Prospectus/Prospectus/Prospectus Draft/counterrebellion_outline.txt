#Theory Outline

## Framing

- Rebel groups are often the de facto government in some areas
- Rebel victories are fairly common, this can tell us about how they might govern and be challenged following wars
- Increasing share of violence worldwide

## Empirical Background

- 133 dyads (224 conflict years) fit the pattern since 1989 - fought a non-state actor that was fighting a government (UCDP). ACLED should capture this as well.
- ISIS - 1920 brigades, Al-Shabaab - ASW, LRA - SPLM, LTTE - LTTE-K, M23 - M23-R, Mayi Mayi - RCD, KDP - PUK, AUC - FARC, several Hezbollah dyads, several Taliban dyads
- Median fatalities = 64, mean = 140, max = 2732
- 34 of these dyads involved 2 groups that were each fighting a government
- 567/1281 dyad years since 1989 involve a rebel group that is also in a non-state conflict. 89 rebel groups account for this.
- 215 rebel groups in the same period were not involved in a non-state conflict.
- There are 176 total groups involved in this conflicts.
- 101 of the country years (51 dyads) involve a group that splintered from another.
- In 24 of these dyads, one splintered from the other.
- Cases w/ more that 1,000 total fatalities:
    + Sudan: SPLM-SSDF (both wanted control of South, SSDF a gov ally)
    + Colombia: FARC-AUC (AUC formed by drug cartels, accused of collaborating with gov)
    + Myanmar: Mong Tai/Shan Army-Wa State Army (WSA allied w/ gov)
    + Iraq: KDP-PUK (two main Kurdish parties)

## Analysis 1: The Entry of Counterrebellion Groups

### Processes:
    - Organic - civilian-based grievances
    - 

### Societal Characteristics - social base for additional rebellions

### Conflict Behavior - grievances

### Third Parties

### Ideological Differences

### Expected Value - greed - resources not held by govt

## Analysis 2: The Character of Counterrebellion Conflict

- Does fighting occur in core rebel territory, or along new frontiers?




- Emergence of counterrebellion
- States & counterrebellions
- Conflict outcomes

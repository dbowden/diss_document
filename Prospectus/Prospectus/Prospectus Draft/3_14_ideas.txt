1. lagged network fragmentation -> conflict structure
2. Network of dissident-dissident interactions predicting network of dissident-government interactions

2. what determines fragmentation? Outside intervention? government behavior?


Network concepts to pursue:

- Modularity (Waugh, Fowler et al)

# Cases w/ lots of dissident interactions:

- India 36k
- Palestine 32k
- Thailand 20k
- Russia 14k
- Egypt 13k
- Nigeria 10k
- Bangladesh 10k
- Mexico 10k
- Pakistan 7.7k
- Iraq 7.4k
- Syria 7.2k
- Burma 6.4k

# Chapters

1. Dissident network structure & rebel structure
2. Predictors of network evolution - interactions w/ outside states, conflict dynamics
3. Case studies of Burma
4. Predicting onset of violence? Countries with overly fragmented networks may not be at risk of violence.

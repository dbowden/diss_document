How does dissident network structure relate to the structure of rebellion?

1. Free-riding - more tightly networked movements have greater free-rider incentives, while less connected networks presumably have differing views and thus have value in mobilizing separately (Metternich and the things they cite)

<!-- 2. Modularity - This is really a measure, not a logic  -->

2. Outbidding/internal politics

3. Distribution of private benefits

4. Diffusion of technology (violence)

5. Spillover - network ties in one arena likely to influence those in others

6. Information exchange - see Siegel - bigger networks more likely to engage in high risk mobilization, in part because individuals more likely to have accurate information about risks, strategies, resources

7. Social pressure - punishment for not participating, guilt

8. Sigel - internal and external motivation

9. Response to repression

#Hypotheses

1. Network density (connections/possible connections) -> fewer groups
2. Network modularity -> more groups
3. Infighting -> new groups
4. Changes in outside support network spill over to dissident network
5. Government campaigns affect network, contingent on prior structure 
6. Mediation calls -> more groups
7. Pre-war network structure determines prob of changes in structure

Resource distribution in a network?

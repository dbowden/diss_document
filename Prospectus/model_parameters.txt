# Model Building Blocks

- Geographic distance - mean center of group activity
- Overlapping membership
- Ethnicity and religion (requires coding, but is manageable)
- Group type - party, militia, etc. - would expect cross-type ties, few within type (b/c why not just join the same group)
- Government repression (overall, and localized by space and target)
- Strength (troop count / election results)
- Stability - how long-standing is the relationship
- Interdependence - how much violence is being used by others
    - Total - this has an inverse relationship with the cost of violence
    - In network - this has an inverse relationship with the value of violence
- Cost for breaking existing ties
- Utility has curvilinear relationship with winning coalition size
- Government strength

- Heterogeneity in terms of how much factions weight these things
- Value of revolution varies by individual
- Risk propensity/willingness to use violence varies by individual

# Potential Network Effects

- Free-riding
- Social pressure
- Threshold/safety in numbers
- Information/tactical diffusion
- Change in inherent interests/motives

# Processes

- Fragmentation
- Aggregation
- Formation

# Initial setup

- Some in nonviolent groups, some individuals
- Individuals can join any group (though joining nonviolent has little value)
- Nonviolent groups can become violent
- Individuals can leave a group, but there is a cost (varies by extent of social ties)

# Simplifications

- Reduce membership overlap, ethnicity, religion and geography to a single social distance parameter.

## -----------------------------------------

# First Cut

- Agents have heterogenous positions on a left-right spectrum
- Agents have heterogenous (but positive) cost of fighting
- New gov takes on the median position of the members of the winning coalition (weighted by strength)
- All agents have positive value from any revolution (relative to status quo), but exact value depends on distance from ideal point
- Utility (fighting) = gov ideal point - agent ideal point - cost of fighting
- Utility (not fighting) = gov ideal point - agent ideal point
- Agents will fight when their effort moves the gov ideal point by an amount that outweighs the cost of fighting
- Cost of fighting decrease as the number of fighters increases
- Contest function:

# Complications

- Network ties of various paramters - density, structure, etc.
- Network ties are based on homophily, and thus ties will correlate with ideal points
- Multidimensional space / disaggregated social ties - network ties won't conform perfectly to ideal points
- Incomplete info - you know your networks' utility, but not others
- Incomplete info - you don't know what everyone weights most heavily (where ideal points lie)
- International actors reveal info about ideal points
- Norms against free riding - infighting as a response to free riding
- Realignment/Fragmentation

# Preliminary Expectations

- Networks have a variegated effect - if someone has a large/tight network, their likelihood of shifting the ideal point in a meaningful way is higher - lots of support for their position
- OTOH, a big and/or active network creates possibility for free riding

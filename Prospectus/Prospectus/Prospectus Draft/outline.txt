Consolidation of dissent

- Why do some civil wars feature multiple rebel groups, while others are less complex?
	- Exclude secessions over different territories
	- Often there is an existing rebel group - why not join?

- Explanations
	- Politicization - if a group has fought previously or has ideological content, it is more likely to be opposed. Or, a honeymoon effect.
    - Goal diversity - indicated by protests 
	- Social cohesion - ethnolinguistic diversity
	- Transnational - proximity of border, permeability of border, proximity of existing groups, involvement of outside states
   

- Components
    + Incentives to cooperate
    + Incentives to retain independence
    + Modifiers: resources

- Data work / analysis
    + Code political content of rebel groups, connection to pre-war politics
        * What their tendencies are - left/right, religious, ethnic
        * Degree of centrality to identity
    + Analysis of group count
    + Fragmentation index (would network analysis be useful here?)

- Extensions / spin-offs
    + Content analysis of social media to determine group approval ratings
    + Descriptive paper on complexity
    + Complexity and the conflict process
    + Spatial patterns and the conflict process - does violence get more remote as conflict ends?
    + Spatial analysis comparing original conflict and recurrences
    + Sub-national tax rates or welfare spending mapped to conflict events (the princeton people have this for Iraq)

- Types of complexity
    + Fragmentation - splintering
    + Non-state conflict
    + Formation of new groups when another already exists

Key questions:

1. Why do some groups persist across multiple conflicts?

2. Why does new dissent lead to new groups, rather than new support for old groups?

- Is it better to have separate groups from the beginning than to form a coalition that later splits?

- Failure of previous conflict management attempts --- prisoner's dilemma, also international story about why no conflict management

- Weak economy after previous war

- Geography

- Multiple tracks --- recurrence, transnational, politicization of militias

- Are groups more likely to persist if they are fragmented?

- Does external support play a role in fragmentation? Could the end of the cold war be a discontinuity?

- Spatial component - do existing rebels and new waves of dissent fail to coalesce because they are physically separated? Is there a certain type of conflict termination (low intensity?) that is especially likely to result in remote groups?

- Are there any cases where a new group emerges, but later forms an alliance with the existing group?

- Social ties during wartime - drawing on Staniland and Mampilly.

- Look at SCAD/NAVCO, see what attributes I can link to groups

- General framework: at the individual or faction level, what do dissidents want? Ideal points. Cooperation problems.

- Territorial acquisition as a predictor of conflict complexity?

- Behavior of territory-controlling vs. not-controlling groups toward civilians, toward govt
- Where do joiners go? Spatial relationship between rebel groups
- Behavior of joiners vs. originators - more or less likely to pursue resources
- Govt role in rebel structure
- Cooperation/conflict between non-state actors (ICEWS)
- Values survey or Afrobarometer measures of identification w/ nation predicted by changes in rebel territorial control

1. Start at the individual - individuals have a variety of political goals that wax and wane in salience

2. Individuals form factions on the basis of political affinity, but also non-political ties such as ethnicity or trade, and any government rules restricting associations

3. Factions want to maximize the proximity of the post-war government to their ideological platform, while minimizing their effort

4. Network ties between factions are the result of affinity/homophily, but possibly also strategic considerations - bandwagoning to maximize power in the short run, etc. ***

5. Node-level analysis: more connected factions will produce less violence / more likely to produce violence

6. Country-level analysis: sparse and/or modular networks should produce more violent groups

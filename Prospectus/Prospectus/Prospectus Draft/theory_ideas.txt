Theoretical Mechanisms

#What Pulls Opposition Movements Apart
- Geography - distance, rough terrain, etc.
- Free-rider incentive
- Different ideal points for new govt
- Ethnic / linguistic / religious / class differences
- Outside support
- Private benefits (incentives to minimize groups size)
- Desire to stay close to home, defend civilians (TITLE: How Far Are You Willing to Go?)

#What Holds Them Together?
- Ethnic ties
- Other social structure - existing military or communal organizations
- Strategic violence by rebels
- Government behavior
- Private benefits (incentives for current members to stay)

#Other
- In the process of mobilization for war, to what extent are rebel groups able to subsume existing organizations?
- Does territorial control matter?
- Contagion vs. competition dichtotomy from spatial lit

# New Outline (2/10)

- Framework: dissent is group of individuals in the country who are opposed to the govt and have some willingness to use violence. There is a distribution of ideal points regarding the make-up of new govt. Also vary on dimension of commitment to the cause. Dissidents want a group that is close to their ideal point, but also have free-rider incentives. Interaction between dissidents who are not original members of existing group and existing group.

- I: Material? Micro? cleavages:
    + Political goals vs. personal gain (resources)
    + Civilian violence - this could be community defense, lowered barrier interacting with distance from existing groups (civilian deaths)
    + Collective action across distance (distance from existing groups)

- II: Political? Macro? cleavages:
    + Differences in political goals (data collection)
    + Hardliner/spoiler unhappiness with prior results (gleditsch data)

#Two Pathways

1. Based on actor data:

- Weak groups
- Groups with political wings
- Transnational groups
- Previously active groups

2. Based on spatial data:

- Civilian violence
- Resources

3. Peacekeeping FDI paper
4. Protest rebellion connection paper
5. Public opinion towards rebel groups using social media data
6. What does it take to get a seat at the table? Participation in violence and inclusion in peace talks - maybe using MAR or EPR?
7. Violence against civilians and identities using survey data.
8. Something with refugees/IDPs - how do they affect peace? What do they tell us about how other actors relate to civilians?
9. Ships Passing in the Night - explaining the lack of conflict between rebels using lotker-volterra models.
10. Pre-war crime statistics or survey results that would indicate level of interpersonal conflict, connected to conflict patterns.
11. Social media data to construct actual dissident network for a country - how does connectedness matter?
12. Borrowing costs - hard to do during civil wars, but maybe broader view of unrest?
13. Forecasting conflict attributes - joiners, duration, severity, ceasefires, etc.
